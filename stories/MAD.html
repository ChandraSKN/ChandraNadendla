<p>In the busy city of Mumbai, life never stopped. The sun was going down, and the sky turned orange and purple. All around, people hurried home, street vendors packed up, and cars honked in traffic. In the middle of this rush stood <strong>Sarasvati Siksha University (SSU)</strong>, a place where students studied hard and hoped for a bright future.</p>
<p>Gowtham, a young man with a restless spirit, found himself in the dimly lit depths of the
university’s car park. As he sat in his car, the world outside faded into obscurity, shielding him
from the clamour of Mumbai's relentless energy. Lost in his thoughts, he was startled by the
shrill ring of his phone. Its screen displayed the name 'Ravi,' and without hesitation, Gowtham
answered.</p>
<p>'I am coming, give me ten minutes,' Gowtham replied hurriedly, his voice laced with urgency.
Ravi's terse response, 'Come fast, we need to move the body,' sent a chill down Gowtham's
spine.</p>
<p>With nimble fingers, Gowtham accessed a clandestine app on his phone, an indispensable tool
that granted him control over the college's security systems. A swift click of a switch button
within the app triggered a notification, 'Car park access granted.' The gates groaned open,
allowing him passage. Exiting his car, Gowtham sprinted toward the door, his eyes fixated on
his watch, the minutes ticking away relentlessly.</p>
<p>Through the labyrinthine corridors, Gowtham navigated, his watch screen continuously
swiped, as if trying to manipulate time itself. Finally, he arrived at a dimly lit location,
illuminated only by feeble emergency lights scattered along the walls. The atmosphere was
heavy with anticipation as Gowtham tapped his watch, causing a small red light to emanate,
accompanied by a subtle beep. In the soft glow, a young woman emerged, her silhouette hinting
at a familiar figure. Without hesitation, she rushed towards Gowtham, enveloping him in a tight
embrace. It was Shreya, the object of Gowtham's affection. In that moment, their worlds
converged, offering solace amidst the turmoil that awaited them.</p>
<p>Soon, three more figures emerged from the shadows. Ravi, Divya, and Naresh, their faces
etched with a mixture of worry and trepidation. As Gowtham approached them, his voice
strained with concern, he called out to Ravi, demanding to know what had transpired. Divya
interjected, her words laced with theatrical flair, 'Murder,' she uttered with a hushed intensity,
the weight of the unknown heavy upon them. Immediately, Ravi interjected, casting doubt on
Divya's assumption. "We don't know yet," he replied with a hint of scepticism in his voice.
Divya's retort came swiftly, laced with sarcasm. "Oh, in what world does a person choose uni
theatre to die naturally?" she quipped, her words dripping with irony. Ravi responded with a
bemused look, silently acknowledging the absurdity of the situation.</p>
<p>Curiosity burned within him, and Gowtham pressed Ravi for an explanation on why he had
decided not to involve the police. The silence that followed spoke volumes, each member of
the group exchanging furtive glances. Suspicion gripped Gowtham, and he turned to Shreya,seeking answers. "Shreya, what happened?" he implored, his voice tinged with a mix of
concern and frustration.</p>
<p>Shreya hesitated for a moment, her gaze shifting between Gowtham and Ravi. Finally, she
mustered the courage to speak. "G, actually..." Her voice trailed off, and she looked towards
Ravi, urging him to reveal the truth. Gowtham's gaze intensified, a flicker of anger creeping
into his voice. "Ravi, you tell me, “He demanded, his tone laced with a sense of urgency.
Ravi began to mumble, struggling to find the right words. "Actually, there was a knife... and
fingerprints... and footprints..." he managed to utter, his voice faltering. Divya's eyes narrowed
as she locked her gaze onto Ravi, her accusatory tone cutting through the tension. "It's your
fault. Dad warned me about your irresponsible behaviour. You are going to drag us all down,"
she asserted, her words seething with resentment.</p>
<p>Ravi's voice trembled as he responded, shocked by his sister's revelation. "Did Dad really say
that?" he whispered; his voice filled with disbelief. Divya's sarcastic smirk remained firmly in
place as she replied, "More or less, the same meaning." Ravi's confusion deepened as he
questioned Divya's motives. "If you knew I was trouble, why did you follow me?" he asked,
his voice tinged with hurt. Divya's retort was swift and cutting. "I wanted to know what you
were hiding," she stated firmly.</p>
<p>Ravi insisted, "I didn't hide anything from you." Divya, undeterred, fired back, "What about
the ice cream I left in the fridge? You ate it." Ravi's face contorted in disbelief. "I didn't eat it.
Ask Mom if you want," he protested. Divya, unyielding, shot back, "Mom always supports
you. I know." Gowtham observed the exchange with a suspicious gaze, silently keeping his
own secret about devouring the ice cream.</p>
<p>Growing impatient, Gowtham intervened, demanding clarity from the group. "Come on, guys.
Can someone please tell me what happened?" Naresh, who had been silent until now, finally
spoke up. "I think we messed up," he confessed, his voice filled with a mixture of fear and
guilt. "I don't know what happened exactly, but I saw Ravi holding the knife next to the body."
Ravi interrupted, countering Naresh's claim. "I saw Shreya holding the knife and entering the
theater hall," he insisted, his voice tinged with accusation. Shreya, frustration evident in her
tone, interjected, "For God's sake, how many times do I have to tell you? That was not a knife;
it was my hair clip." Divya came in between and said, "I didn't do anything, I just followed
Ravi." Everyone looked at Divya angrily.</p>
<p>Gowtham silenced the heated exchange, his voice cutting through the tension. "So, what are
you all trying to say?" he asked, his gaze shifting between his friends. Naresh spoke up once
again, revealing a troubling truth. "The whole dead body is covered in all four of our
fingerprints and footprints," he confessed. "If we inform anyone about it, no one is going to
trust us."</p>
<p>As Naresh was explaining their involvement, Divya attempted to speak up, but each time,
someone interrupted her. Frustration building, she finally shouted, "Guys, the dead body!"
Everyone turned their attention to Divya, eager to hear what she had to say. With a trembling
voice, she continued, "The dead body is missing. “All eyes darted towards the spot where Divya
pointed, only to find an empty space. Surprisingly, there was no trace of the corpse, but the
entire floor was splattered with blood. Panic gripped the group as they realized the evidencewas vanishing before their eyes. Ravi's hesitation to involve the police suddenly made sense to
Gowtham. Ravi frantically searched for the murder weapon, but it was nowhere to be found.
He understood that Ravi's reluctance was driven by their participation in the upcoming SSP
competition.</p>
<p>Gowtham and the rest joined the search, scouring every corner of the scene. The tension in the
air was palpable as they desperately looked for any sign of the missing body or weapon. The
dimly lit theatre hall added an eerie ambiance to the search, the shadows playing tricks on their
minds. Each creaking sound and flickering light heightened their anxiety.</p>
<p>In the midst of the chaos, Divya's fear-stricken voice cut through, "I think we should leave. It's
getting late, and we've spent too much time at the crime scene." Her suggestion hung in the air,
and everyone contemplated the consequences of staying any longer. The fear of being caught,
of the truth unravelling, weighed heavily on their minds.</p>
<p>Ravi pondered the situation and voiced his concern. "What about our footprints? If there's no
body or weapon, our footprints will be the only evidence to file a case against us. We won't
have any proof to defend ourselves." Naresh, who had been quiet until now, spoke up with a
mysterious tone, his voice filled with an unexpected suggestion. "We should clean up the
evidence."</p>
<p>Ravi readily agreed, understanding the urgency of the situation. They couldn't afford to leave
any trace behind, any shred of evidence that could link them to the crime. The group's collective
decision was made, acknowledging the risks they faced. They knew they had to clean up the
crime scene to eliminate any trace of their involvement.</p>
<p>One by one, they retrieved cleaning tools from the theatre hall's storage room. Gowtham
grabbed a wet mop, its bristles dripping with water, while Ravi took a dry mop, ready to absorb
any remaining stains. Naresh and Shreya armed themselves with cloths and cleaning spray,
their determined expressions masked their fear. Divya, holding a dusting tool in her trembling
hand, tried to keep up her composure amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>As the group assembled with their respective tools, Ravi could not resist a sarcastic remark
directed at Divya, trying to lighten the heavy atmosphere. "What will you do with that?" he
asked, pointing at the dusting tool. Divya, despite the tension, retorted in the same sarcastic
tone, a touch of dark humour in her voice, "Sorry, brother, it's my first murder... I mean, the
first murder I've ever seen."</p>
<p>With a mixture of trepidation and determination, they set to work. The sound of mops sweeping
across the bloodstained floor echoed through the empty theatre hall. The pungent smell of
cleaning chemicals mingled with the metallic scent of blood, creating an odd combination that
permeated the air. Each member of the group scrubbed and wiped; their movements almost
robotic as they tried to erase any trace of their presence.</p>
<p>The task felt never-ending, the minutes stretching into hours as they meticulously cleaned the
bloodstains, ensuring not a single spot remained. The intensity of their focus was unwavering,
fuelled by the fear of discovery. Every sound, every creaking floorboard, sent a jolt of anxiety
through their veins.As they continued their frantic efforts, a newfound sense of unity emerged among the group.</p>
<p>Despite their conflicting emotions and accusations, they had no choice but to rely on each other
to escape the clutches of the impending doom. Each stroke of the mop, each spray of the
cleaning solution, became a symbolic act of trust and solidarity.</p>
<p>The minutes turned into hours, and exhaustion weighed heavily on their shoulders. Drops of
sweat rolled down their foreheads, mixing with the remnants of blood on their faces. But they
persisted, determined to leave no trace behind. The theatre hall slowly transformed from a
crime scene to a sterile, sanitized space, devoid of any evidence of their involvement.
Finally, as the last remnants of blood were wiped away, a sense of relief washed over them.
They had done their best to clean up the mess they had unwittingly become a part of. But the
underlying unease remained, lingering like a shadow in the back of their minds. The missing
body, the vanishing evidence—it was a mystery they could not escape.</p>
<p>Exhausted and emotionally drained, they gathered their cleaning tools, careful to leave no trace
of their presence behind. As they prepared to leave the theatre hall, the weight of their actions
settled upon them. They had tampered with a crime scene, hidden the truth, and embarked on
a dangerous path. The consequences of their choices loomed over them, threatening to unravel
their lives.</p>
<p>With heavy hearts, they made their way out of the theatre hall, each step filled with uncertainty.
The darkness of the night outside mirrored the uncertainty that now engulfed their lives. They
had crossed a line, and there was no turning back.</p>
<p>As they dispersed into the night, the events of that evening remained etched in their minds. The
murder, the missing body, the collective decision to clean up the evidence—they were bound
together by secrets and guilt. The mystery had just begun, and they were entangled in a web of
intrigue and danger that would test their loyalty and resilience.</p>
<p>Little did they know that their actions had set in motion a series of events that would lead them
deeper into the darkness, unravelling a web of secrets and lies that would threaten not only
their friendships but also their very lives. The truth was out there, waiting to be discovered, and
they were about to embark on a journey that would change everything they thought they knew.
And so, with hearts heavy and minds filled with anticipation, they stepped into the unknown,
ready to face the consequences of their actions and delve deeper into the intricate puzzle of the
first murder they had ever encountered. The game had just begun, and the stakes were higher
than they could have ever imagined</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 2: The Day We Met</strong></p>
<p>Perfect crimes may seem flawless as long as they remain secret. However, even the most
meticulously planned schemes could unravel if those involved fail to remain silent in times of
adversity. Now, the question arises: can these five individuals truly keep their secret? Are they
genuinely as close as they appear?</p>
<p>To uncover the answers, we must trace back to the day they first met, the inception of the SSP
Club—the origin of their journey.</p>
<p>Eight months prior, these individuals, excluding Divya and Ravi, had no connection to one
another. It was a single decision made by Rama Prabha, the head of the Science Group at
Sarasvati Siksha University (SSU), that would forever alter their lives.</p>
<p>In an effort to promote practical and application-oriented learning and nurture young talent,
Rama Prabha launched a program known as the SSP Club—Special Science Projects Club.
This initiative aimed to select 150 students from colleges across India. Only five of these
students would secure a coveted spot in the club, entitling them to a scholarship that would
offer them to study in any top universities like Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, and Stanford.
Furthermore, these fortunate individuals would also have the unique opportunity to contribute
to India's esteemed defence project, Kavach, working closely with the national government.
However, gaining a spot in the top five required successfully navigating three rounds of
rigorous selection.</p>
<p><strong>The Announcement</strong></p>
<p>The sun cast a warm glow over the sprawling campus of Sarasvati Siksha University (SSU),
an institution steeped in history and renowned for its rich academic tradition. The old university
buildings stood tall, their grand architecture a testament to the knowledge that had been
cultivated within their walls for generations. SSU boasted state-of-the-art laboratories,
advanced research facilities, and a faculty of highly talented professors who nurtured young
minds with their wisdom and expertise.</p>
<p>On a bright morning, the open hall of SSU buzzed with anticipation as 150 aspiring scientists
and innovators gathered. Their eyes sparkled with hope, each carrying dreams of making a
mark in the world of science. This was the day they would meet Rama Prabha, the esteemed
head of the Science Group at SSU and the driving force behind the SSP Club.</p>
<p>Rama Prabha, a distinguished scientist with a passion for nurturing young talent, stepped onto
the stage. Her presence commanded attention, and a hushed silence fell over the hall. As she
began to speak, her voice carried a sense of authority combined with genuine warmth.</p>
<p>"Welcome, aspiring scientists and innovators," Rama Prabha's words echoed through the hall,
resonating with a contagious enthusiasm. "Today, we embark on a journey that will push the
boundaries of your scientific abilities and ignite your creative spirits. The SSP Club
competition is not just a platform for showcasing your skills; it is an opportunity to transform
yourselves into true scientific visionaries."</p>
<p>She paused, allowing her words to sink in, as the participants leaned forward, captivated by her
presence."You have been chosen from among thousands of students across India for your exceptional
talent and dedication to the pursuit of knowledge. The SSP Club will test your scientific
prowess, critical thinking, teamwork, and innovative spirit."</p>
<p>Rama Prabha's eyes scanned the eager faces before her, taking in the anticipation and
determination radiating from the students.</p>
<p><strong>"Let me take you through the three stages that await you in this remarkable journey."</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Stage 1: Group Project Challenge - "The Enigma Experiment" "In this stage, you will
form groups of five," Rama Prabha continued, her voice filled with excitement. "Each
group will be assigned a unique scientific problem, known as 'The Enigma Experiment.'
These problems have been carefully designed to challenge your intellect and creativity.
Your task is to collaborate, design, and execute an innovative experiment that addresses
the problem and presents a groundbreaking solution. You will have a limited timeframe
to conduct your experiments, analyse data, and prepare a comprehensive project report.
Remember, teamwork is key as you learn to leverage each other's strengths and work
towards a common goal."</li>
</ol>
<p>The participants exchanged glances, their minds already buzzing with ideas, as they
contemplated the possibilities that lay ahead.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Stage 2: Face-to-Face Rounds - "Scientific Showdown" "The top-performing groups
from Stage 1 will advance to the Face-to-Face Rounds," Rama Prabha announced, her
voice brimming with intensity. "These rounds will be a true test of your scientific
acumen and problem-solving skills. You will find yourselves in a specially designed
laboratory setting, facing real-life scientific scenarios. From identifying unknown
substances to solving complex equations and performing intricate laboratory
techniques, you must showcase your scientific knowledge under pressure. It is not only
about individual brilliance but also about effective communication, collaboration, and
teamwork. Renowned scientists and industry experts will be observing and judging
each challenge, assessing your ability to apply scientific principles effectively in a
competitive environment."</li>
</ol>
<p>The room filled with a mix of determination and nervous anticipation as the participants
absorbed the magnitude of the challenges that awaited them.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stage 3: Individual Prototype Showcase - "Innovation Expo" "Forthe final stage," Rama
Prabha continued, her voice filled with anticipation, "the competition will shift to
individual performance, where each participant will have the opportunity to showcase
their unique scientific talents and innovations."</li>
</ol>
<p>She paused, a smile gracing her lips as she observed the enthusiasm and curiosity in the eyes
of the participants.</p>
<p>"In the Individual Prototype Showcase, you will have the freedom to explore any area of
science that aligns with your interests and expertise. This is your chance to delve deep into
your chosen scientific field and develop your own prototype—an embodiment of your
creativity and scientific prowess. Your prototypes will be presented at the grand 'Innovation
Expo,' a gathering attended by esteemed scientists, industry leaders, and the public. Theevaluation criteria will focus on innovation, practicality, scientific rigor, and the potential
impact your prototype can have on society."</p>
<p>The participants exchanged excited whispers, their minds already buzzing with ideas for their
individual prototypes, envisioning the possibilities and impact their creations could make.
"I have faith in each and every one of you," Rama Prabha concluded, her voice filled with pride
and encouragement. "You have been handpicked for this extraordinary opportunity because
you possess the passion, talent, and dedication that can shape the future of scientific
exploration. Embrace this journey, learn from one another, and let your scientific spirits soar."</p>
<p>As Rama Prabha stepped off the stage, a renewed sense of purpose filled the hall. The
participants could feel the weight of responsibility and the magnitude of the competition. They
knew that SSU, with its rich history and exceptional resources, had provided them with the
platform they needed to shine.</p>
<p><strong>The Dinner</strong></p>
<p>After Rama Prabha's speech, the open hall reverberated with a cacophony of voices as the
participants engaged in excited chatter. Anticipation and nervous energy filled the atmosphere,
creating a palpable buzz. However, the sudden interruption of Dr Vishnu Vardhan, the
psychology professor, brought an immediate hush over the room. Dr Vardhan, a commanding
presence with his tall stature, broad shoulders, and muscular build, stepped forward, casting a
shadow of silence over the crowd.</p>
<p>"Sorry, everyone," Dr Vardhan announced, his voice cutting through the noise. "The
competition has been cancelled." A wave of surprise and disappointment washed over the
participants as they turned their attention to the professor.</p>
<p>Dr Vardhan, wearing a peculiar smile, continued, "But let me tell you, this statement can be
true for anyone of you at any moment if I catch you making any mistakes." He paused for a
moment, letting his words sink in. "I will share an interesting quote that might give you clarity
about your stay here for the next nine months: 'For surviving a hundred times, you need to be
lucky a hundred times. But to die, you just need to be unlucky once.'"</p>
<p>His words hung heavy in the air, and the room fell into a contemplative silence. Dr Vardhan's
gaze swept across the room as he continued, "SSU is not here to make your individual futures
bright; that responsibility lies with your parents. We are here to make the world bright, and for
that, I will not hesitate to push you all into the darkness. I know some of you might think I am
a sadist, questioning how one's behaviour can be used to judge their talent. But believe me, I
am much more than what you think. This is an opportunity that has the power to change your
lives. So, limit your actions, not your thoughts."</p>
<p>The weight of Dr Vardhan's words settled upon the participants, leaving them with a mix of
uncertainty and determination. They understood that their journey at SSU would be
challenging, and that success would require more than just scientific knowledge and skills.
Dr Vishnu Vardhan concluded by reminding everyone to dress appropriately and join the
dinner, emphasizing the importance of maintaining good behaviour throughout the evening.The evening arrived, and one by one, the participants made their way into the hall around 7:00
PM. Among the crowd, a lady dressed in a stunning red long dress caught everyone's attention.
It was none other than Shreya, who seemed to have a group of admirers following her every
move. On the other hand, Naresh, the unnoticed figure, entered the hall in an old suit that looked
older than the university itself.</p>
<p>While Shreya became the centre of attention, male students like Gowtham and Vivek engaged
in a silent competition to impress the female students. Gowtham, dressed impeccably as a
gentleman, caught the eyes of many, but he seemed disinterested in the beauty competition
unfolding before him. Instead, he quietly sipped a fruit punch in a corner. Vivek, on the other
hand, was determined to eliminate his competitors before the start of the first round. He took
out a small butterfly drone from his pocket and set it flying. Using his smartwatch, Vivek
maneuverer the drone to fly directly over the students' eyes, causing them to drop their drinks
onto the professor. Vishnu Vardhan, known for his observant nature, noticed the students'
actions but did not respond immediately, silently adding their names to his list of potential
troublemakers.</p>
<p>Growing frustrated, Vivek decided to take his actions further and directly target Vishnu
Vardhan. He directed the butterfly drone to fly over Naresh as he was about to pass by Vishnu
Vardhan. Vivek pressed the up arrow on his watch, causing the drone to fly high into the air,
and then adjusted its angle to make it swoop down towards Naresh. As the butterfly flew over
Naresh's eyes, he shook and accidentally flipped his juice glass. However, Gowtham, who
happened to be standing between Naresh and Vishnu Vardhan, shielded the professor from the
flying juice, causing it to land on Gowtham instead. Vishnu Vardhan felt the impact and saw
the juice stains on Gowtham's coat, leading him to take notice of Naresh's involvement.
Just as Vishnu Vardhan was about to confront Gowtham, a mysterious man in a black suit, long
hair, and a trimmed beard approached them. He placed his hand on Gowtham's shoulder,
turning him around, and discreetly sprayed something on Gowtham's coat. When Gowtham
finally turned to face Vishnu Vardhan, the professor was surprised to find no trace of juice
stains on the coat. Intrigued, Vishnu Vardhan left the scene, leaving Gowtham and Naresh
relieved. They looked at the man in gratitude and curiosity, asking how he managed to remove
the stains and who he was. The man introduced himself as Ravi and explained that he used his
"Vanish Spray," which contained ethyl alcohol and chelating agents to break down and remove
the metal ions in the juice stain. Gowtham interjected, mentioning polyethylene glycol (PEG)
and dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as surfactants in Ravi's product, confirming his knowledge. The
two of them embraced, impressed with each other's skills.</p>
<p>Their conversation was interrupted by Divya, who playfully sprayed a perfume bottle on
Gowtham's coat, changing the colour from black to blue. This surprised everyone around them.
Ravi, in a sarcastic tone, commented on Divya's show-off, and Divya responded with a playful
expression. Amidst the banter, Naresh revealed that the reason he had flipped his glass was
because of the butterfly drone. Gowtham immediately identified Vivek as the culprit behind
the drone's actions. Ravi and Divya expressed their determination to handle the situation.
Naresh assured them that they had already showcased their skills and now it was his turn to
take action. He took out his flip phone and used its scanning capabilities to detect the butterfly
drone's communication protocols. With a few taps on his phone, Naresh gained control over
the drone and made it perform loops of rapid ascents and descents until it eventually exploded.
Laughter filled the air as they celebrated their successful retaliation.After a satisfying dinner, as everyone started leaving the hall, Vivek and his friends Varun and Ritik approached Naresh, Gowtham, Divya, and Ravi, seeking retribution for the destruction of Vivek's drone. Tensions escalated, and a fight seemed imminent. However, just as things were about to escalate further, Vishnu Vardhan's voice echoed through the hall, commanding them to run as fast as they could if they wanted to avoid consequences. Without looking back,
Vivek and his friends sprinted towards their rooms, fearing the professor's wrath.</p>
<p>The voice resounded loudly, causing everyone to pause in their tracks. It posed a question,
asking if it should reveal something individually to each of them. Suddenly, Gowtham burst
into laughter, finding amusement in the situation. He complimented the device, acknowledging
its impressiveness but pointed out that its timing was off. As he spoke, Shreya emerged from
the darkness, her face concealed behind a metallic mask. With a sense of intrigue, she removed
the mask and questioned Gowtham, asking how he knew about her hidden identity. In response,
Gowtham proudly displayed his phone, which granted him access to all the security cameras
in the university. He specifically highlighted footage of Vishnu Sir walking near Block A.</p>
<p>At first, everyone was impressed by Shreya's masked appearance, but as they witnessed
Gowtham's hacking skills and his control over the security cameras, their reactions shifted to
awe. Smiles spread across their faces as they exchanged glances, realizing the incredible talents
within their group. They proceeded to walk together, moving slowly and confidently towards
their respective rooms.</p>
<p>Little did they know that the challenges they would encounter in the coming days would not
only test their scientific abilities but also their moral compass, their loyalty, and their ability to
keep secrets. The path they had chosen was fraught with danger and uncertainty, and the
choices they would make would have far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p>But for now, they allowed themselves a moment of anticipation, excitement, and camaraderie,
cherishing the memories of the day they first met—the day that would forever bind their fates
together and set them on a collision course with destiny.</p>
<p>The next chapter of their journey awaited, and with it, the unfolding of a mystery that would
grip them all, pushing them to their limits and forcing them to confront the darkness that lurked
within their own hearts</p>

1: My First Murder\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the busy city of Mumbai, life never stopped. The sun was going down, and the sky turned orange and purple. All around, people hurried home, street vendors packed up, and cars honked in traffic. In the middle of this rush stood \u003cstrong\u003eSarasvati Siksha University (SSU)\u003c/strong\u003e, a place where students studied hard and hoped for a bright future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham, a young man with a restless spirit, found himself in the dimly lit depths of the\nuniversity’s car park. As he sat in his car, the world outside faded into obscurity, shielding him\nfrom the clamour of Mumbai's relentless energy. Lost in his thoughts, he was startled by the\nshrill ring of his phone. Its screen displayed the name 'Ravi,' and without hesitation, Gowtham\nanswered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e'I am coming, give me ten minutes,' Gowtham replied hurriedly, his voice laced with urgency.\nRavi's terse response, 'Come fast, we need to move the body,' sent a chill down Gowtham's\nspine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith nimble fingers, Gowtham accessed a clandestine app on his phone, an indispensable tool\nthat granted him control over the college's security systems. A swift click of a switch button\nwithin the app triggered a notification, 'Car park access granted.' The gates groaned open,\nallowing him passage. Exiting his car, Gowtham sprinted toward the door, his eyes fixated on\nhis watch, the minutes ticking away relentlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the labyrinthine corridors, Gowtham navigated, his watch screen continuously\nswiped, as if trying to manipulate time itself. Finally, he arrived at a dimly lit location,\nilluminated only by feeble emergency lights scattered along the walls. The atmosphere was\nheavy with anticipation as Gowtham tapped his watch, causing a small red light to emanate,\naccompanied by a subtle beep. In the soft glow, a young woman emerged, her silhouette hinting\nat a familiar figure. Without hesitation, she rushed towards Gowtham, enveloping him in a tight\nembrace. It was Shreya, the object of Gowtham's affection. In that moment, their worlds\nconverged, offering solace amidst the turmoil that awaited them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, three more figures emerged from the shadows. Ravi, Divya, and Naresh, their faces\netched with a mixture of worry and trepidation. As Gowtham approached them, his voice\nstrained with concern, he called out to Ravi, demanding to know what had transpired. Divya\ninterjected, her words laced with theatrical flair, 'Murder,' she uttered with a hushed intensity,\nthe weight of the unknown heavy upon them. Immediately, Ravi interjected, casting doubt on\nDivya's assumption. \"We don't know yet,\" he replied with a hint of scepticism in his voice.\nDivya's retort came swiftly, laced with sarcasm. \"Oh, in what world does a person choose uni\ntheatre to die naturally?\" she quipped, her words dripping with irony. Ravi responded with a\nbemused look, silently acknowledging the absurdity of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity burned within him, and Gowtham pressed Ravi for an explanation on why he had\ndecided not to involve the police. The silence that followed spoke volumes, each member of\nthe group exchanging furtive glances. Suspicion gripped Gowtham, and he turned to Shreya,seeking answers. \"Shreya, what happened?\" he implored, his voice tinged with a mix of\nconcern and frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShreya hesitated for a moment, her gaze shifting between Gowtham and Ravi. Finally, she\nmustered the courage to speak. \"G, actually...\" Her voice trailed off, and she looked towards\nRavi, urging him to reveal the truth. Gowtham's gaze intensified, a flicker of anger creeping\ninto his voice. \"Ravi, you tell me, “He demanded, his tone laced with a sense of urgency.\nRavi began to mumble, struggling to find the right words. \"Actually, there was a knife... and\nfingerprints... and footprints...\" he managed to utter, his voice faltering. Divya's eyes narrowed\nas she locked her gaze onto Ravi, her accusatory tone cutting through the tension. \"It's your\nfault. Dad warned me about your irresponsible behaviour. You are going to drag us all down,\"\nshe asserted, her words seething with resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavi's voice trembled as he responded, shocked by his sister's revelation. \"Did Dad really say\nthat?\" he whispered; his voice filled with disbelief. Divya's sarcastic smirk remained firmly in\nplace as she replied, \"More or less, the same meaning.\" Ravi's confusion deepened as he\nquestioned Divya's motives. \"If you knew I was trouble, why did you follow me?\" he asked,\nhis voice tinged with hurt. Divya's retort was swift and cutting. \"I wanted to know what you\nwere hiding,\" she stated firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavi insisted, \"I didn't hide anything from you.\" Divya, undeterred, fired back, \"What about\nthe ice cream I left in the fridge? You ate it.\" Ravi's face contorted in disbelief. \"I didn't eat it.\nAsk Mom if you want,\" he protested. Divya, unyielding, shot back, \"Mom always supports\nyou. I know.\" Gowtham observed the exchange with a suspicious gaze, silently keeping his\nown secret about devouring the ice cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing impatient, Gowtham intervened, demanding clarity from the group. \"Come on, guys.\nCan someone please tell me what happened?\" Naresh, who had been silent until now, finally\nspoke up. \"I think we messed up,\" he confessed, his voice filled with a mixture of fear and\nguilt. \"I don't know what happened exactly, but I saw Ravi holding the knife next to the body.\"\nRavi interrupted, countering Naresh's claim. \"I saw Shreya holding the knife and entering the\ntheater hall,\" he insisted, his voice tinged with accusation. Shreya, frustration evident in her\ntone, interjected, \"For God's sake, how many times do I have to tell you? That was not a knife;\nit was my hair clip.\" Divya came in between and said, \"I didn't do anything, I just followed\nRavi.\" Everyone looked at Divya angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham silenced the heated exchange, his voice cutting through the tension. \"So, what are\nyou all trying to say?\" he asked, his gaze shifting between his friends. Naresh spoke up once\nagain, revealing a troubling truth. \"The whole dead body is covered in all four of our\nfingerprints and footprints,\" he confessed. \"If we inform anyone about it, no one is going to\ntrust us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Naresh was explaining their involvement, Divya attempted to speak up, but each time,\nsomeone interrupted her. Frustration building, she finally shouted, \"Guys, the dead body!\"\nEveryone turned their attention to Divya, eager to hear what she had to say. With a trembling\nvoice, she continued, \"The dead body is missing. “All eyes darted towards the spot where Divya\npointed, only to find an empty space. Surprisingly, there was no trace of the corpse, but the\nentire floor was splattered with blood. Panic gripped the group as they realized the evidencewas vanishing before their eyes. Ravi's hesitation to involve the police suddenly made sense to\nGowtham. Ravi frantically searched for the murder weapon, but it was nowhere to be found.\nHe understood that Ravi's reluctance was driven by their participation in the upcoming SSP\ncompetition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGowtham and the rest joined the search, scouring every corner of the scene. The tension in the\nair was palpable as they desperately looked for any sign of the missing body or weapon. The\ndimly lit theatre hall added an eerie ambiance to the search, the shadows playing tricks on their\nminds. Each creaking sound and flickering light heightened their anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the midst of the chaos, Divya's fear-stricken voice cut through, \"I think we should leave. It's\ngetting late, and we've spent too much time at the crime scene.\" Her suggestion hung in the air,\nand everyone contemplated the consequences of staying any longer. The fear of being caught,\nof the truth unravelling, weighed heavily on their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavi pondered the situation and voiced his concern. \"What about our footprints? If there's no\nbody or weapon, our footprints will be the only evidence to file a case against us. We won't\nhave any proof to defend ourselves.\" Naresh, who had been quiet until now, spoke up with a\nmysterious tone, his voice filled with an unexpected suggestion. \"We should clean up the\nevidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavi readily agreed, understanding the urgency of the situation. They couldn't afford to leave\nany trace behind, any shred of evidence that could link them to the crime. The group's collective\ndecision was made, acknowledging the risks they faced. They knew they had to clean up the\ncrime scene to eliminate any trace of their involvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one, they retrieved cleaning tools from the theatre hall's storage room. Gowtham\ngrabbed a wet mop, its bristles dripping with water, while Ravi took a dry mop, ready to absorb\nany remaining stains. Naresh and Shreya armed themselves with cloths and cleaning spray,\ntheir determined expressions masked their fear.

Divya, despite the tension, retorted in the same sarcastic\ntone, a touch of dark humour in her voice, \"Sorry, brother, it's my first murder... I mean, the\nfirst murder I've ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a mixture of trepidation and determination, they set to work. The sound of mops sweeping\nacross the bloodstained floor echoed through the empty theatre hall. The pungent smell of\ncleaning chemicals mingled with the metallic scent of blood, creating an odd combination that\npermeated the air. Each member of the group scrubbed and wiped; their movements almost\nrobotic as they tried to erase any trace of their presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe task felt never-ending, the minutes stretching into hours as they meticulously cleaned the\nbloodstains, ensuring not a single spot remained.

Drops of\nsweat rolled down their foreheads, mixing with the remnants of blood on their faces. But they\npersisted, determined to leave no trace behind. The theatre hall slowly transformed from a\ncrime scene to a sterile, sanitized space, devoid of any evidence of their involvement.\nFinally, as the last remnants of blood were wiped away, a sense of relief washed over them.\nThey had done their best to clean up the mess they had unwittingly become a part of. But the\nunderlying unease remained, lingering like a shadow in the back of their minds. The missing\nbody, the vanishing evidence—it was a mystery they could not escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExhausted and emotionally drained, they gathered their cleaning tools, careful to leave no trace\nof their presence behind. As they prepared to leave the theatre hall, the weight of their actions\nsettled upon them. They had tampered with a crime scene, hidden the truth, and embarked on\na dangerous path. The consequences of their choices loomed over them, threatening to unravel\ntheir lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith heavy hearts, they made their way out of the theatre hall, each step filled with uncertainty.\nThe darkness of the night outside mirrored the uncertainty that now engulfed their lives. They\nhad crossed a line, and there was no turning back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they dispersed into the night, the events of that evening remained etched in their minds. The\nmurder, the missing body, the collective decision to clean up the evidence—they were bound\ntogether by secrets and guilt. The mystery had just begun, and they were entangled in a web of\nintrigue and danger that would test their loyalty and resilience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle did they know that their actions had set in motion a series of events that would lead them\ndeeper into the darkness, unravelling a web of secrets and lies that would threaten not only\ntheir friendships but also their very lives.

Anticipation and nervous energy filled the atmosphere,\ncreating a palpable buzz. However, the sudden interruption of Dr Vishnu Vardhan, the\npsychology professor, brought an immediate hush over the room.

We are here to make the world bright, and for\nthat, I will not hesitate to push you all into the darkness. I know some of you might think I am\na sadist, questioning how one's behaviour can be used to judge their talent. But believe me, I\nam much more than what you think. This is an opportunity that has the power to change your\nlives. So, limit your actions, not your thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weight of Dr Vardhan's words settled upon the participants, leaving them with a mix of\nuncertainty and determination. They understood that their journey at SSU would be\nchallenging, and that success would require more than just scientific knowledge and skills.\nDr Vishnu Vardhan concluded by reminding everyone to dress appropriately and join the\ndinner, emphasizing the importance of maintaining good behaviour throughout the evening.The evening arrived, and one by one, the participants made their way into the hall around 7:00\nPM. Among the crowd, a lady dressed in a stunning red long dress caught everyone's attention.\nIt was none other than Shreya, who seemed to have a group of admirers following her every\nmove. On the other hand, Naresh, the unnoticed figure, entered the hall in an old suit that looked\nolder than the university itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Shreya became the centre of attention, male students like Gowtham and Vivek engaged\nin a silent competition to impress the female students. Gowtham, dressed impeccably as a\ngentleman, caught the eyes of many, but he seemed disinterested in the beauty competition\nunfolding before him. Instead, he quietly sipped a fruit punch in a corner. Vivek, on the other\nhand, was determined to eliminate his competitors before the start of the first round. He took\nout a small butterfly drone from his pocket and set it flying. Using his smartwatch, Vivek\nmaneuverer the drone to fly directly over the students' eyes, causing them to drop their drinks\nonto the professor. Vishnu Vardhan, known for his observant nature, noticed the students'\nactions but did not respond immediately, silently adding their names to his list of potential\ntroublemakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing frustrated, Vivek decided to take his actions further and directly target Vishnu\nVardhan. He directed the butterfly drone to fly over Naresh as he was about to pass by Vishnu\nVardhan. Vivek pressed the up arrow on his watch, causing the drone to fly high into the air,\nand then adjusted its angle to make it swoop down towards Naresh. As the butterfly flew over\nNaresh's eyes, he shook and accidentally flipped his juice glass. However, Gowtham, who\nhappened to be standing between Naresh and Vishnu Vardhan, shielded the professor from the\nflying juice, causing it to land on Gowtham instead. Vishnu Vardhan felt the impact and saw\nthe juice stains on Gowtham's coat, leading him to take notice of Naresh's involvement.\nJust as Vishnu Vardhan was about to confront Gowtham, a mysterious man in a black suit, long\nhair, and a trimmed beard approached them. He placed his hand on Gowtham's shoulder,\nturning him around, and discreetly sprayed something on Gowtham's coat. When Gowtham\nfinally turned to face Vishnu Vardhan, the professor was surprised to find no trace of juice\nstains on the coat. Intrigued, Vishnu Vardhan left the scene, leaving Gowtham and Naresh\nrelieved. They looked at the man in gratitude and curiosity, asking how he managed to remove\nthe stains and who he was. The man introduced himself as Ravi and explained that he used his\n\"Vanish Spray,\" which contained ethyl alcohol and chelating agents to break down and remove\nthe metal ions in the juice stain. Gowtham interjected, mentioning polyethylene glycol (PEG)\nand dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as surfactants in Ravi's product, confirming his knowledge. The\ntwo of them embraced, impressed with each other's skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir conversation was interrupted by Divya, who playfully sprayed a perfume bottle on\nGowtham's coat, changing the colour from black to blue. This surprised everyone around them.\nRavi, in a sarcastic tone, commented on Divya's show-off, and Divya responded with a playful\nexpression. Amidst the banter, Naresh revealed that the reason he had flipped his glass was\nbecause of the butterfly drone. Gowtham immediately identified Vivek as the culprit behind\nthe drone's actions. Ravi and Divya expressed their determination to handle the situation.\nNaresh assured them that they had already showcased their skills and now it was his turn to\ntake action. He took out his flip phone and used its scanning capabilities to detect the butterfly\ndrone's communication protocols. With a few taps on his phone, Naresh gained control over\nthe drone and made it perform loops of rapid ascents and descents until it eventually exploded.\nLaughter filled the air as they celebrated their successful retaliation.After a satisfying dinner, as everyone started leaving the hall, Vivek and his friends Varun and Ritik approached Naresh, Gowtham, Divya, and Ravi, seeking retribution for the destruction of Vivek's drone. Tensions escalated, and a fight seemed imminent. However, just as things were about to escalate further, Vishnu Vardhan's voice echoed through the hall, commanding them to run as fast as they could if they wanted to avoid consequences. Without looking back,\nVivek and his friends sprinted towards their rooms, fearing the professor's wrath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice resounded loudly, causing everyone to pause in their tracks. It posed a question,\nasking if it should reveal something individually to each of them. Suddenly, Gowtham burst\ninto laughter, finding amusement in the situation. He complimented the device, acknowledging\nits impressiveness but pointed out that its timing was off. As he spoke, Shreya emerged from\nthe darkness, her face concealed behind a metallic mask. With a sense of intrigue, she removed\nthe mask and questioned Gowtham, asking how he knew about her hidden identity. In response,\nGowtham proudly displayed his phone, which granted him access to all the security cameras\nin the university. He specifically highlighted footage of Vishnu Sir walking near Block A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, everyone was impressed by Shreya's masked appearance, but as they witnessed\nGowtham's hacking skills and his control over the security cameras, their reactions shifted to\nawe. Smiles spread across their faces as they exchanged glances, realizing the incredible talents\nwithin their group. They proceeded to walk together, moving slowly and confidently towards\ntheir respective rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle did they know that the challenges they would encounter in the coming days would not\nonly test their scientific abilities but also their moral compass, their loyalty, and their ability to\nkeep secrets. The path they had chosen was fraught with danger and uncertainty, and the\nchoices they would make would have far-reaching consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for now, they allowed themselves a moment of anticipation, excitement, and camaraderie,\ncherishing the memories of the day they first met—the day that would forever bind their fates\ntogether and set them on a collision course with destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next chapter of their journey awaited, and with it, the unfolding of a mystery that would\ngrip them all, pushing them to their limits and forcing them to confront the darkness that lurked\nwithin their own hearts\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"7:[\"$\",\"article\",null,{\"className\":\"prose prose-lg mx-auto py-16 px-4 max-w-3xl\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"text-4xl font-extrabold mb-4\",\"children\":\"MAD\"}],[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"className\":\"text-sm text-gray-500 mb-8\",\"children\":\"5/19/2025\"}],[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"className\":\"prose prose-lg lg:prose-xl space-y-6 text-justify mx-auto\",\"style\":{\"textAlign\":\"justify\"},\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"$15\"}}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"mt-12 flex justify-between text-indigo-600\"}],[\"$\",\"$L16\",null,{\"storyId\":\"MAD\"}]]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"viewport\",\"content\":\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"}]]\nb:null\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:{\"metadata\":[[\"$\",\"title\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"CSKN\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"CSKN Website\"}]],\"error\":null,\"digest\":\"$undefined\"}\ne:{\"metadata\":\"$14:metadata\",\"error\":null,\"digest\":\"$undefined\"}\n"])</script></body></html>
