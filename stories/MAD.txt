15:T15fd,<h3><strong>Chapter 1: My First Murder</strong></h3>
<p>In the busy city of Mumbai, life never stopped. The sun was going down, and the sky turned orange and purple. All around, people hurried home, street vendors packed up, and cars honked in traffic. In the middle of this rush stood <strong>Sarasvati Siksha University (SSU)</strong>, a place where students studied hard and hoped for a bright future.</p>
<p>Gowtham, a young man with restless thoughts, sat alone in his car in the university’s parking lot. The bright lights of the campus buildings felt far away. As he stared at his phone, a call came in from Ravi. Gowtham’s heart raced.</p>
<p>“I’m coming. Give me ten minutes,” he said, voice shaking.</p>
<p>“Come fast. We need to move the body,” Ravi replied in a low, urgent tone. Gowtham’s blood ran cold.</p>
<p>On his phone, Gowtham opened a secret app he used to control the college’s security gates. He tapped a button, and a message flashed: <strong>“Car park access granted.”</strong> The metal barrier lifted with a loud screech. He jumped out of the car and ran toward the main building, checking his watch every few seconds.</p>
<p>Inside, the corridors were dim and quiet, lit only by faint emergency lights. Gowtham’s watch beeped, and a small red light appeared on his wrist. Ahead, he saw a figure step out of the shadows. It was Shreya, his girlfriend. Relief and fear mixed in his chest as he threw his arms around her.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” he whispered. “I’m here.”</p>
<p>Behind her, three more friends emerged—Ravi, Divya, and Naresh. Their faces were pale and worried. Gowtham rushed to Ravi. “What happened?” he asked, voice low.</p>
<p>Divya’s lips trembled. “Murder,” she said in a whisper.</p>
<p>Ravi shook his head. “We don’t know yet,” he said carefully.</p>
<p>Divya gave him a short laugh. “In what world does a person die naturally in the university theatre?” she asked, sounding bitter.</p>
<p>Gowtham frowned. “Why haven’t we called the police?” he pressed.</p>
<p>The group fell silent. Everyone looked at everyone else. Finally, Gowtham turned to Shreya. “Shreya, tell me,” he urged.</p>
<p>She hesitated, then glanced at Ravi. “G… actually…” Her voice trailed off.</p>
<p>“Ravi, you tell him,” Gowtham said sharply.</p>
<p>Ravi’s voice shook. “There was a knife… and fingerprints… and footprints,” he mumbled.</p>
<p>Divya’s eyes flashed at Ravi. “This is your fault. Dad warned me about your reckless ways. And now look where we are.”</p>
<p>Ravi looked hurt. “He really said that?” he whispered.</p>
<p>Divya shrugged. “More or less.”</p>
<p>Gowtham watched them all, uneasy. Then Naresh spoke up, voice quiet. “I think we messed up. I saw Ravi holding the knife next to the body.”</p>
<p>Ravi snapped back, “I saw Shreya holding it when she came into the theatre.”</p>
<p>Shreya’s face twisted in frustration. “That wasn’t a knife—it was a hair clip!”</p>
<p>Divya sighed. “I didn’t do anything. I just followed Ravi.”</p>
<p>Gowtham raised his hand. “Enough. What exactly happened?”</p>
<p>Naresh swallowed hard. “All four of us left our fingerprints and footprints on the body and around the hall. If we tell anyone, no one will believe us.”</p>
<p>Just then, Divya gasped. “The body… it’s gone!”</p>
<p>They all looked at the spot she pointed to. The corpse was gone. Only a pool of blood remained on the floor. Panic swept through them.</p>
<p>Ravi’s face went pale. “No body, no weapon… our footprints are the only proof against us.”</p>
<p>Naresh spoke up again, quietly. “We should clean everything before someone notices.”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. They knew he was right. They crept into the theatre’s storage room and found mops, clothes, and cleaning spray. Gowtham grabbed a wet mop, Ravi took a dry one, Shreya and Naresh picked up clothes, and Divya held a feather duster.</p>
<p>Ravi teased Divya as she held the duster. “What will you do with that?”</p>
<p>Divya managed a weak smile. “Hey, it’s my first murder… first time I’ve seen one, at least.”</p>
<p>They worked in tense silence, scrubbing the floor and walls. The smell of bleach mixed with the faint metallic scent of blood. Every creak of the floor made their hearts pound faster.</p>
<p>As they cleaned, something unexpected happened: they began to help one another, passing tools and gently guiding each other’s arms. In that terrible moment, they relied on each other completely.</p>
<p>Minutes passed like hours. Finally, the last bloodstain vanished. The theatre hall looked spotless, as if nothing had ever happened. They dropped their tools, exhausted and shaken.</p>
<p>They looked around at each other. What they had done—covering up a crime scene—felt wrong, but they saw no other choice. Outside, the night was dark and silent. They left the hall one by one, hearts heavy with guilt.</p>
<p>On the steps, Gowtham paused. He thought about the missing body and the hidden knife. Some part of him feared this was only the beginning. They had cleaned away the proof, but they could not erase what they had seen—or what they might do next.</p>
<p>As they disappeared into the Mumbai night, each of them carried a secret that would bind them together—and call their loyalty and courage into question. The first murder they ever faced had changed everything. They were no longer just students at SSU. They were something else now, and they didn’t know if they could ever go back to the way things were before.</p>
